DataSet from 
- Student Liftstyle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset
- Clothes Classification https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanbadai/clothes-dataset/data
  - For Neural Network api,Unfortunately I dont have any budget to deploy on any platform because model too large
    so pls clone  https://github.com/6604062630421/Modelapi and pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt and run python app.py
    on port 5000 and it'll be fine and can run neural network predict on website
    Thank you
